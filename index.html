        <p>Hi, guys.</p>

        <p>
            I have been a Mac developer for about 10 years. You can see some of my commercial Mac apps here:
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="http://www.pixelegg.me/">http://www.pixelegg.me</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            And now i am fully working on a free & open source PDF editor for Mac. its name is PEP (PDF Editing
            Program).
        </p>

        <p>
            And it's in the very early stage of development, and i need some fund to fully work on it even it's in the
            very
            early stage, I know it's too early to request fund, but sometimes we need money in real life, and i'm in
            this
            situation now.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently i am focus on the core of PEP, which as you can see is the PDF engine from scratch, which means
            PEP
            will not depend on any other PDF libraries elsewhere, PEP is self contains in some means.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am enjoying working on the Core which is called Gene. And the most important I need some fund to support
            the
            development, any fund will help. So i just public the unfinished website and the github repo here, and
            seeking
            someone will help me.
        </p>

        <p>
            PEP is a free & open source PDF editor for Mac. And it's in the very begining of development.
            I would recommend someone to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/aaronelkins" class="red-color">donate</a> and
            speed the development progress.
        </p>

        <p>
            This site is under construction, but if you are interested in the code,
            just check it out on <a href="https://github.com/orklann/PEP">Github</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Last words, I think PEP would be an open source alternative for PDF Expert.
            But not for macOS Preview, since PEP aims to be a lightweight alternative for Adobe Acrobat. :D
