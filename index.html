        <p>Hi Everyone,</p>

        <p>
            I am working on a free and open source PDF editor for macOS called PEP (PDF Editing
            Program). It is a lightweight & open source alternative to Adobe Acrobat.
        </p>

        <p>
            PEP is still in the very early stages of development, and I am in need of funds to fully focus on it.
            Ideally, I would like to improve PEP more before
            requesting donations, but unfortunately because of my living situation I need funds now.
        </p>


        <p>
            PEP is an ambitious project as it includes its own PDF engine, built from scratch. Therefore PEP will be
            self-contained and not rely on
            third-party PDF libraries.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm currently focussed on building out this engine, called Gene, which is the core of PEP. It is primarily
            this component for which I need
            funding. I have published everything I have so far in the hope that someone will see its potential and
            donate towards it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been a Mac developer for about 10 years. You can see some of my commercial Mac apps here:

        <p>
            If you would find PEP useful and want to help it succeed, please donate at <a
                href="https://www.patreon.com/aaronelkins" class="red-color">my Patreon</a>
            to speed up the development process. Alternatively, you can follow me as <a
                href="https://twitter.com/ryh1113">Aaron Elkins on Twitter</a> to help
            spread the word.
        </p>

        <p>
            Everything is still under construction, but if you are interested in the PEP code,
            you can find <a href="https://github.com/orklann/PEP">PEP on GitHub</a>.

            Always check out the <a href="/download">Download</a> page for new release, currently just prototype
            alhpha releases, but I will add more and more features soon and later.
