                    How time flies.  It has been 9 months since I started to develop PEP as an open-source project. 
                    For readers who did not know about PEP, PEP is an open-source PDF editor for Mac developed from 
                    scratch without any third-party PDF engine dependence. PEP has its core - called Gene.
                </p>

                <h4 class="news-section-title">
                    What things PEP has done
                </h4>

                <p>
                    At the time of writing. PEP has more than 10,840 lines of code, 245 stars and 1,025 commits 
                    on <a href="https://github.com/orklann/PEP" target="_blank">Github</a>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have made the PDF engine from scratch - Gene. Gene has a PDF primary objects lexer and 
                    parser, which is robust and fast. It's also the foundation of all other parts of the code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also have other important parts, including GDocument, GPage, GTextParser, GInterpreter, 
                    GGlyph, GWord, GLine, GTextBlock. These are the foundation of PEP. We carefully code the project,
                     for correctness, and easily reading and maintenance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here is a simple demo of how PEP works:
                </p>

                </p>

                <p>
                </p>

                <h4 class="news-section-title">
                    What I want PEP to be
                </h4>

                <p>
                    I want PEP to be a robust, fast, lightweight alternative to Adobe Acrobat, and the most important 
                    is, PEP is open to accept any useful features from users. I recently collected a lot of small 
                    features which users always request for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have any feature suggestions, please fill this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qBoLQRo96ZiiCVTHyk1Bgh149gbU4k8hCC0ijthPgSQ/viewform?edit_requested=true" target="_blank">Google Form</a>, 
                    so that I can get them and implement them.
                </p>

                <h4 class="news-section-title">
                    Conclusion
                </h4>

                <p>
                    I will continue to work on PEP as an open-source project, but any donations (even $1) will encourage 
                    me to continue to work on PEP and give me more energy and passion. I am not asking for much money, 
                    I just need responses from the community and my users for this long-time project. I want to know 
                    how many people care about this project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So if you are willing to donate $1 to let me know you care about this project, here is my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/aaronelkins" title="Patreon" target="_blank">Patreon</a> page.
